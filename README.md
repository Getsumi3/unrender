# unrender

Three.js renderer for large data set of points.

This library was created a while back, and I'm not longer using this actively.

Instead to render graphs my go to is [graph-start](https://github.com/anvaka/graph-start)
project, that is based on lightweight [w-gl](https://github.com/anvaka/w-gl) library

# install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

```
npm install https://github.com/anvaka/unrender.git
```
